                solution secured our victory by addressing real-world challenges 
                faced by individuals with disabilities in navigating public transportation.

            In the ideation phase, we explored various solutions, considering options like a personal assistance 
            request system and paratransit booking. However, our collective decision pointed towards a 
            crucial need: providing users with real-time information on accessibility.
